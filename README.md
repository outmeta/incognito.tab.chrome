Incognito is the term used to denote opening a private browsing window in Google Chrome. Other browsers refer to this process as a "private window," "privacy mode," or "private browsing mode." The purpose for using an incognito or private tab is to conceal any web locations you visit or information you enter as you visit websites. While you use this mode, your browser won't remember or record your online activity.

An incognito tab can eliminate tracing from local sources and conceal your online histories from those with access to your personal computer. Although browsing in private mode won't record visited sites, download cookies or save passwords, it does not necessarily erase all online records from your internet provider or network administrators. In this mode, your browsing is still tracked and recorded by your Wi-Fi and the websites you visit, which differs from using an anti-tracker device on your computer.
